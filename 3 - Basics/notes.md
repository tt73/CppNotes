## Argc and Argv
* argc is the number of args (always >0)
* argv is a list of args
* argv[0] is the command that you entered e.g. `./tut1`

## Variable types
* short int < int < long
* float < double < long double
* float is only accurate up to 6 digits, double can go up to 15
* unsigned is good when working with non-negative numbers
* you can check memory usage of variables with `sizeof(var)`
* `stoi` converts string to integer
* `stod` converts string to double

## I/O
* cout is followed by <<, and then something to print
* cin is followed by >>, and then a variable to hold the input
* printf is very useful
* %c for char, %d for integers, %f for floats, %s for string
